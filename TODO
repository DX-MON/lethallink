Project Setup:
 ✔ Pick name @done (2020-05-31 13:43)
 ✔ Pick licenses @done (2020-05-31 13:43)

Hardware:
 ☐ Finish power supply calculations
   ☐ 1v2 rail
   ☐ 1v5 rail
   ☐ 1v8 rail
   ☐ 2v5 rail

 ☐ Initial routing of power supply

 ☐ Start on the schematic component for the PCIe bus connection
   ☐ Route PCIe traces

 ☐ Find (Q)SPI flash module for gateware and firmware
   ☐ Hook up flash to FPGA
   ☐ Route flash

 ☐ Find LPDDR3 module (8GiB?) for cache (ECC?) [Depends on LPDDR core]
   ☐ Hook up RAM to FPGA
   ☐ Route RAM (ugh)

 ☐ Settle on data exfiltration interface (Just use USB3? Gigabit Serial?)

 ☐ Design hardware debug interface (high speed level-shifters needed most likely) (Mezzanine boards?)
   ☐ Generic GPIO based (JTAG, etc)
   ☐ Specialized
     ☐ Intel
       ☐ SVT
       ☐ ITP-XDP
     ☐ AMD
       ☐ ?????? (Need to figure that out)

Gateware:
 ☐ Sort out the RISC-V Management Core
   ☐ Look into using Lambdasoc / Minerva

 ☐ Sort out PCIe DMA engine
   ☐ Look into litepcie (migen, would need port)

 ☐ Sort out LPDDR3 core
   ☐ Look into litedram (migen, would need port)

 ☐ Integrate Management Core into PCIe and LPDDR3 cores (AXI? Wishbone?)

 ☐ Sort out the USB3 bus to the CYUSB3014 (Some sort of DMA core?)

 ☐ Hardware debug core design
   ☐ JTAG

   ☐ Intel
     ☐ SVT
     ☐ ITP-XDP
   ☐ AMD
     ☐ ?????

   ☐ GDB Server (? Should be in Firmware not gateware, but I want to try to build a gateware version)

Firmware:
  ☐ Scaffold out the management core firmware

  ☐ Bootstrap CYUSB3014 firmware

Software:
 ☐ Scaffold client software (Linux only, I don't really care about Windows)
