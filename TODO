   ✔ 1v2 rail @done (2020-06-14 01:22)
   ✔ 1v5 rail @done (2020-06-14 01:22)
   ✔ 1v8 rail @done (2020-06-14 01:22)
   ✔ 2v5 rail @done (2020-06-14 01:22)
 ☐ Run numbers for bank enable voltage dividers for proper power-on sequencing (R10/11, R15/16, R18/20, R17/19)
 ☐ Possibly re-do the supply schematic, it's messy.
 ☐ Double check power supply calculations

 ✔ Initial routing of power supply @done (2020-06-14 22:49)

 ☐ Source ESD diodes for USB lines
 ☐ Figure out what to do with VBUS (Pull high?)
   It's weird because we're a USB device, but like, self-powered, This also calls into question what to do with GND.

 ☐ Figure out how on earth to bring up the FPGA

 ✔ Start on the schematic component for the PCIe bus connection @done (2020-06-18 01:23)
   ✔ Route PCIe traces @done (2020-06-21 15:56)

 ✔ Find SPI flash module for gateware and firmware @done (2020-06-14 15:53)
 ✔ Hook up flash to FPGA @done (2020-06-18 01:23)
 ☐ Route flash

 ✔ Find LPDDR3 module (8GiB?) for cache (ECC?) [Depends on LPDDR core] @done (2020-06-14 15:06)
   SODIMM? Need a memory controller
 ☐ Hook up RAM to FPGA
 ☐ Route RAM (ugh)

 ☐ Settle on data exfiltration interface (Just use USB3? Gigabit Serial?)

 ☐ Properly figure out the interface between the FPGA and PHY

 ☐ Design hardware debug interface (high speed level-shifters needed most likely) (Mezzanine boards?)
   ☐ Generic GPIO based (JTAG, etc. minimal Glasgow-like)
   ☐ Specialized
     ☐ Intel
       ☐ SVT
       ☐ ITP-XDP
     ☐ AMD
       ☐ ?????? (Need to figure that out)

 ☐ Go through and re-check all the resistor values for the LEDs

Gateware:
 ☐ Sort out the RISC-V Management Core
   ☐ Look into using Lambdasoc / Minerva

 ☐ Sort out PCIe DMA engine
   ☐ Look into litepcie (migen, would need port)

 ☐ Sort out LPDDR3 core
   ☐ Look into litedram (migen, would need port)

 ☐ Integrate Management Core into PCIe and LPDDR3 cores (AXI? Wishbone?)

 ☐ Sort out the USB3 bus to the CYUSB3014 (Some sort of DMA core?)

 ☐ Hardware debug core design
   ☐ JTAG
   ☐ Intel
     ☐ SVT
     ☐ ITP-XDP
   ☐ AMD
     ☐ ?????
   ☐ GDB Server (? Should be in Firmware not gateware, but I want to try to build a gateware version)
   ☐ PCIe DMA watchpoints

Firmware:
  ☐ Scaffold out the management core firmware

  ☐ Bootstrap CYUSB3014 firmware

  ☐ GDB Server in management core?

Software:
 ☐ Scaffold client software (Linux only, I don't really care about Windows)
 ☐ GDB integration
